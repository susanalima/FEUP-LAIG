## Third Project

### Specification

Development of a graphical interface for a board game. 
The application, who already included the logical aspects of the game, was developed using the prolog language, by [Susana Lima](https://github.com/susanalima) and [Gonçalo Santos](https://github.com/gregueiras),
([FEUP-PLOG repository](https://github.com/susanalima/FEUP-PLOG) ).
As such, this project implements a way for both parts, graphical interface and prolog application, to communicate with each other. 
The board game chosen for this project was Manalath.

### Execution

* Open **SICStus Prolog** and consult the file `server.pl` present in the Manalath directory.
* After consulting the file run the command `server` in **SICStus Prolog**.
* Create a local server, this can be achieved using an executable like **Mongoose**, this should open a new browser window.
* While in the new browser window open the folder named `Graphic_Interface`.
