# FEUP-LAIG
Projects developed for Graphical Applications Laboratory class.

Made in colaboration with [Afonso Azevedo](https://github.com/4-Z3r0).

## First Project and Second Project

Development of a graphics engine in WebGL. 

### First Scene

This scene consists of a small lego inspired room.

### Second Scene

This scene consists of a small island with a animated spacecraft. This project was developed over the first one by adding shaders (water movement), animations (spaceship movement) and nurbs (spaceship design).

## Third Project

### Specification

Development of a graphical interface for a board game. 
The application, who already included the logical aspects of the game, was developed using the prolog language, by [Susana Lima](https://github.com/susanalima) and [Gon√ßalo Santos](https://github.com/gregueiras),
([FEUP-PLOG repository](https://github.com/susanalima/FEUP-PLOG) ).
As such, this project implements a way for both parts, graphical interface and prolog application, to communicate with each other. 
The board game chosen for this project was Manalath.

### Implemented Features

- [X] Illumination.
- [x] Two different game scenarios (space and garden).
- [x] Movement of game pieces.
- [x] Three game modes: Player vs Player, Player vs Bot, Bot vs Bot
- [x] Three game levels: easy,medium and hard.
- [x] Camera animation.
- [x] Game menu: start new game and undo last play.
- [X] Game movie: see the last game played (replay).
- [X] Score.
- [X] Timer.


### Execution

* Open **SICStus Prolog** and consult the file `server.pl` present in the Manalath directory.
* After consulting the file run the command `server` in **SICStus Prolog**.
* Create a local server, this can be achieved using an executable like **Mongoose**, this should open a new browser window.
* While in the new browser window open the folder named `Graphic_Interface`.
